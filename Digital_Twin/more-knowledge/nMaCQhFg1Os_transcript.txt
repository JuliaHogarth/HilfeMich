I'm convinced that if you don't like
soup this is the one that's going to
change your mind it's a super rich Curry
lentil soup and the best part is that it
comes together in less than 30 minutes
to a pot with some olive oil add in
yellow onion potatoes carrots garlic
cloves and a chicken Boolean Cube cook
that down for a few minutes then add in
wash and Dred lentils curry powder cumin
black pepper and salt pour in water
cover and let this simmer for about 25
minutes or until the veggies are tender
then blend that up using an immersion
blender squeeze in lemon juice to finish
it all off and then it's ready to serve
I like to top mine with some chili oil
fresh parsley homemade cre tons and
enjoy
